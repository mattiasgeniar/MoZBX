# Introduction: Mobile Zabbix

This project is intended as an extra application, built on top of your current [Zabbix](http://www.zabbix.com) set-up.

It connects to your Zabbix API URL, using your Zabbix credentials. Afterwards, all settings are pulled from your Zabbix.
This means any change you make in your Zabbix, will be transported to the Mobile ZBX application.

If you're worried about security implications, please read more on the FAQ at http://www.mozbx.net.

For more install guides (on your phone, or on your own servers), please see http://www.mozbx.net/install.html.

### About the configuration file

There's a file called "config-live.php" included. Rename that to "config.php" and modify it as you see fit. That file is unique to you, and won't change with future updates.
